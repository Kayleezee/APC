\section{Experiment: Shared Counter Performance Analysis}
We performed the experiments for the shared counter performance
analysis on \emph{moore} and on a home computer with an Intel
i5 760 @ 2.80 GHz. You can see our results in figure \ref{plot}, \ref{plotbig},
\ref{plotbigtotal} and \ref{plottotal}. We did two test series: the first
one with $10^5$ and the second with $10^7$ counter increasements. You
see clearly in figure \ref{plot} and \ref{plottotal} that the measured
times are very unstable. We think this happened, because other effects
dominated the time measurements. 

In the other test series (figure \ref{plotbig} and \ref{plotbigtotal}) with
$10^7$ counter increasements, you can see more stable results. The results
in figure \ref{plotbigtotal} look like what we expected, as the total
time does not increase significantly for increasing thread counts
in case of ATOMIC and MUTEX tests.
We expected that, as the communication between threads should be
limited due to latency. Furthermore the relatively low measured total
times for one or two threads is reasonable, because there is less
communication necessary and the compuational intensity of every thread
is nearly zero.

That the time in figure \ref{plotbigtotal} increases for higher thread
counts in case of LOCK\_RMW seems reasonable to us, as this experiment
is executed with a self written mutex, which is based on atomic operations.
Of course this self written mutex is not optimized on hardware level, thus
leads to worse time measurements.

All the aspects we discussed on the behaviour of the total time depending
on the thread count can be transferred to the counter increasements
depending on the thread count. You can see in figure \ref{plotbig} that
we do not see new aspects, which are not already clear.
