\section{Parallel Prefix Sum -- Development}
\label{dev}
We provide the code in different files, which we will explain shortly:
\begin{description}
	\item[./src/main.cc] This conains our \texttt{main} function and handles
	command line arguments. You can choose the thread count \texttt{-t},
	the array size \texttt{-s}, the number of measurements to average
	time measurements \texttt{-n}. Furthermore you can skip the 
	sequential calculation, which verifies the parallel results by
	\texttt{-sq} and you can enable array size correction, as the
	program only accepepts array sizes $s$ and thread counts $t$, which
	satisfy
	\[s \;\textnormal{mod}\; t = 0\:.\]
	This means if $s$ does not satisfy this condition the program
	takes another value $s'$ as array size, which is determined by
	\[ s' = s + (t - s\;\textnormal{mod}\; t)\:.\]
	You can enable this option by \texttt{-correct-size}. Furthermore
	our code is templated to enable various numeric types. Especially
	you will run quickly into overflow problems with large arrays, if you
	consider high random numbers and \texttt{int} as the numeric type.
	\item[./inc/thread\_handler.h] This is a generic written
	pthread handling class. You can see it as syntactic sugar.
	\item[./inc/chCommandLine.h] Command line argument handling.
	\item[.time\_measurement.h] This file provides an easy class based way
	to make time measurements in your program.
	\item[./src/thread\_arg.h] Here you can find the class definition of
	our objects, which are given to the threads on creation, thus the
	Thread-Argument-Class.
	\item[./src/thread\_routines.h] provides the prefix scan routine,
	the function, which will be executed by threads on their creation,
	and the random array initialization function.

\section{Parallel Prefix Sum -- Analysis}
We executed the our program using different options of the \texttt{numactl} tool:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
Option Label & Explanation\\\hline
Default & We used \texttt{numactl} without any additional options\\
Membind 0,1 & \texttt{numactl --membind=0,1}, which binds the memory to node 0 and 1\\
Membind 0 & Analog to above with node 0 only\\
Interleave & \texttt{numactl --interleave=all} distribute the memory to all nodes
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
We used two Membind options, because the exercise sheet mentions that \emph{moore} has four
nodes on the contrary to \texttt{numactl --hardware}, which shows eight nodes.
This means we have two definitions of what a 'node' is, thus we performed measurements
binding the used memory to one 'node' for both definitions.

You can see our results using the \texttt{correct-size} option (chapter \ref{dev}) in figure \ref{plot}.
For one thread you see that the Default-Line shows the fastest calculation time. We think
that the other lines show slower calculation times, because the array is not saved on a
node, which is 'near' to the node, which executes the calculation. For the Default-Line and Membind-Lines
you already see a saturation in the calculation time for eight threads. As increasing the
thread count does not lead to faster calculation times, the parallel prefix summation is
a memory bound problem. 
We assume that the default option of \texttt{numactl} places the array on one node,
because the Membind-Lines and Default-Lines approach each other.
Furthermore there is no significant difference between the Membind-Lines, thus the
difference in the definitions of 'node' is not important for our calculation.
The Interleave-Line shows that a distributed array placement to
different nodes is beneficial. The working threads can access faster their data. Nevertheless
we reach a saturation for about 16 threads.
